# :green_book: Panthera Project

For development panthera project, you will only need Node.js & Git installed on your environement.

* **Install Node.js :** Download and install Node.js Version: 8.00 from [official Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) or above (Npm is installed with Node.js). <br/>
**Note:** Make sure you add NPM to the PATH environment variable.
* **Install Git :** Be sure to have `git` available in your PATH to start working locally on an existing remote repository and clone panthera projcet from Gitlab.

# Quick start
## Clone a repository
Clone this repo using terminal on cmd

    $ git clone
    $ cd PROJECT

## Change a repository
If your repository is in master, you must change it to development

    $ git status
    $ git checkout development


## Install Project

    $ npm install


## Build & Start Project
Creating a production build: **npm run build && npm run server** <br/>
To run the react development: **npm run dev**

    $ npm run build
    $ npm run server
    $ npm run dev


# Features
* **ES6/7 Compatible :** ECMAScript is the standardized name for JavaScript. ES6/7 refers to version 6 or 7 of the ECMA Script programming language. It is a major enhancement to the JavaScript language, and adds many more features intended to make large-scale software development easier.
* **Industry-standard i18n internationalization support :** i18N is the process of planning and implementing products and services so that they can easily be adapted to specific local languages and cultures, a process called localization.
* **Next generation CSS :** PostCSS—a CSS post-processor engine—transforms CSS with JavaScript, allowing you to work with the latest CSS features on older browsers.
* **Offline support (Cooming Soon) :** A service worker is a background worker that acts as a programmable proxy, allowing us to control what happens on a request-by-request basis. We can use it to make (parts of, or even entire) React apps work offline. You're in control of how much of your UX is available offline.
* **Quick scaffolding :** Is a meta-programming method of building database-backed software applications. It is a technique supported by some model-view-controller frameworks, in which the programmer may write a specification that describes how the application database may be used. 
    - **Create action :** Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store.
    - **Components :** Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. Components can be rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, one can pass in values that are known as "props"
    - **Containers :** The container component manages the data, actions, business interactions with the rest of the app, while the presentation component only handles presentation with props it receives from its container and any user interactions are passed to the container component instead of itself interacting with the rest of the application.
    - **Interfaces :** Interfaces are mainly concerned with how information should be shared between Logic Hooks and with Pure Components. Interfaces receive functions and values provided by Logic Hooks and share them with other Logic Hooks or pass them as props to Pure Components.
    - **Middleware-express :** Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
    - **Middleware-redux :** Redux middleware the main execution task is the store’s dispatch function. The dispatch function is responsible for sending actions to one or many reducer functions for state changes. 
    - **Language :** The library uses the current interface language, then it loads and displays the strings matching the current interface locale or the default language (the first one if a match is not found) if a specific localization can't be found.
    - **Page :** is a document that is suitable to act as a web resource on the World Wide Web.
    - **Reducer :** The reducer function is a pure function without any side-effects, which means that given the same input (e.g. state and action ), the expected output (e.g. newState ) will always be the same. This makes reducer functions the perfect fit for reasoning about state changes and testing them in isolation.
    - **Route and Story :** React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy code loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in. Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought.
    - **And their Tests :** React Testing Library is a set of helpers that let you test React components without relying on their implementation details.
    - **Right from the CLI! :** he CLI builds and runs a React Server project, using Express. It compiles JS(X) and CSS into efficiently loadable bundles with code splitting using webpack, and it supports hot reloading of React components on the client-side during development.

* **SEO :** Search engine optimization is the process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine.
* **SSR - Server side rendering :** Server-side rendering (SSR) is a popular technique for rendering a normally client-side only single page app (SPA) on the server and then sending a fully rendered page to the client. The client's JavaScript bundle can then take over and the SPA can operate as normal.
* **Typescript Compatible :** Type compatibility in TypeScript is based on structural subtyping. Structural typing is a way of relating types based solely on their members. This is in contrast with nominal typing.

# Documentation
* **commands :** A command is an instruction given by a user telling a computer to do something, such a run a single program or a group of linked programs. Commands are generally issued by typing them in at the command line (i.e., the all-text display mode) and then pressing the ENTER key, which passes them to the shell.
* **state management :** State management libraries provide us with tools for creating these data structures, and updating them when new actions occur.
* **storybook :** Storybook is a user interface development environment and playground for UI components. The tool enables developers to create components independently and showcase components interactively in an isolated development environment.
* **styling :** Styled-components is a library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application that are written with a mixture of JavaScript and CSS.
* **testing :** testing is finding out how well something works, Testing utility package developed that makes testing React components easier.
